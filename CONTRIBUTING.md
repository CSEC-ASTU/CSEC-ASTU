# CSEC HUB Contributing Guidelines ✨

Thank you for considering contributing to our organization's repository! We believe in the power of collaboration and invite you to be a part of making coding better. Your contributions and insights are highly valued.💪

## Commit Guidelines ✍️

- Write clear and concise commit messages.
- Start the commit message with a capitalized verb in the imperative form (e.g., "✨ Add feature," "🐛 Fix bug," "📝 Update documentation").
- Use present tense in the commit message.
- Reference any relevant issue or task numbers in the commit message (e.g., "Fix bug #123").
- Provide a brief description of the changes made in the commit message.

## Branching Strategy 🌿

We follow the GitFlow branching strategy for our repository. Together, we can ensure a structured and efficient development workflow:

- `main` branch: The main branch is the stable production-ready branch.
- `develop` branch: The develop branch is the integration branch for upcoming releases.
- Feature branches: Create a new branch off the `develop` branch for each new feature or task. Use descriptive names for your feature branches (e.g., `feature/add-login-page`).

## Pull Request (PR) Workflow 🚀

To contribute code changes, let's follow these collaborative steps:

1. Fork the repository and create a new branch based on the GitFlow branching strategy.
2. Make your code changes in the new branch.
3. Ensure that your code adheres to our coding standards and conventions.
4. Submit a pull request from your branch to the appropriate target branch (e.g., `develop` for new features).
5. Provide a clear description of the changes, including any relevant context or reasoning.
6. Assign the pull request to a reviewer for feedback and approval.
7. Make any requested changes based on the reviewer's feedback.
8. Once approved, the pull request will be merged into the target branch.

## Questions and Discussions 💬
